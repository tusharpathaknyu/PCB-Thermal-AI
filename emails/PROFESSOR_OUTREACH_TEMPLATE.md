Subject: Research Collaboration Request - ML-Based PCB Thermal Prediction (NYU MS Student)

Dear Professor [NAME],

I hope this email finds you well. My name is Tushar Pathak, and I am a Master's student in Computer Engineering at New York University (Tandon School of Engineering). I am reaching out regarding a research project I am developing at the intersection of machine learning and PCB thermal analysis.

**PROJECT OVERVIEW**

I am building an ML-based PCB thermal predictor that estimates temperature distribution across printed circuit boards directly from layout features (copper density maps, via patterns, component placement, and power dissipation). The goal is to provide rapid thermal feedback during the design phase—enabling engineers to identify hotspots in seconds rather than the hours required for traditional FEM simulation.

**MY BACKGROUND**

- **Current**: MS Computer Engineering, NYU (Expected May 2026)
- **Previous**: BE Electronics & Instrumentation, BITS Pilani, Dubai
- **Industry Experience**: Applications Intern at Texas Instruments, where I developed thermal models for gate drivers and conducted detailed power dissipation analysis
- **Relevant Projects**:
  - *PowerElecLLM*: Fine-tuned Llama 3.1 on TI power management datasheets for technical Q&A
  - *OhmAI*: RAG-based circuit design recommendation system
  - *Home Automation PCB*: Designed and manufactured a custom IoT PCB with ESP32 and relay control
- **Technical Skills**: Python, PyTorch, Altium Designer, SPICE simulation, embedded systems

**THE CHALLENGE: TRAINING DATA**

The primary obstacle in this research is acquiring quality training data. Specifically, I need:
1. PCB layout files (Gerber/KiCAD/Altium) paired with thermal simulation results or measurements
2. Thermal camera measurements of populated boards under operating conditions
3. FEM simulation outputs (temperature fields) from tools like ANSYS Icepak or Cadence Celsius

I understand that such data may exist within your research group's experimental archives or simulation studies. Even anonymized or simplified datasets would be invaluable.

**HOW I COULD CONTRIBUTE**

I am not simply asking for data—I am eager to contribute to your research efforts:
- Develop and share the trained ML model openly with proper attribution
- Collaborate on publications combining physics-based validation with ML predictions
- Assist with other thermal/electronics projects where my ML expertise could help
- Present findings that could benefit your research group or industrial partners

**REQUEST**

Would you have 15-20 minutes for a brief call or video meeting to discuss:
1. Whether your group has relevant thermal data that could be shared
2. Potential collaboration opportunities
3. Your insights on the feasibility and approach of this project

I have attached my resume for your reference and would be happy to provide additional details about my project proposal.

Thank you for considering this request. I genuinely admire your work on [SPECIFIC RESEARCH AREA], and I believe this project aligns with your group's expertise in thermal management and electronics reliability.
