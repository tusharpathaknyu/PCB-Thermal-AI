Subject: Research Partnership Inquiry - Open-Source PCB Thermal Prediction Tool (NYU Graduate Student)

Dear [COMPANY NAME] Engineering Team / [CONTACT NAME],

I am Tushar Pathak, a Master's student in Computer Engineering at New York University with prior experience as an Applications Engineer Intern at Texas Instruments. I am reaching out to explore a potential partnership opportunity around a research project that may align with your interests in PCB design innovation.

---

**THE PROJECT**

I am developing an open-source, ML-based tool that predicts PCB temperature distribution directly from layout features. The goal is to enable hardware engineers to:
- Identify thermal hotspots **in seconds** rather than hours
- Iterate on thermal design during the layout phase
- Reduce prototype failures due to thermal issues

This tool would complement—not replace—detailed FEM simulations like ANSYS Icepak or Cadence Celsius, serving as a rapid screening tool during early design stages.

---

**THE CHALLENGE**

The primary bottleneck is training data. Specifically, I need PCB designs paired with thermal measurements or simulation results. I understand that such data is often proprietary, but I wanted to explore whether:

1. **De-identified datasets** could be shared (component names/values anonymized, geometry preserved)
2. **Evaluation board thermal data** from application notes could be made available
3. **Reference designs** with published thermal analyses could be included
4. **Sponsored measurement campaigns** might be of interest

**WHAT I BRING**

- **Industry Perspective**: Worked at Texas Instruments developing thermal models and application circuits
- **Technical Depth**: Built PowerElecLLM (fine-tuned LLM on TI datasheets) and OhmAI (RAG-based circuit assistant)
- **PCB Experience**: Designed custom IoT PCB with ESP32, relay control, and thermal considerations
- **Academic Rigor**: NYU MS program with focus on ML/AI applications in hardware

---

**PROPOSED NEXT STEPS**

I would welcome the opportunity to:
1. Present the project concept in a 20-minute call with your engineering team
2. Discuss data sharing possibilities under appropriate agreements
3. Explore sponsored research or internship opportunities

Even if data sharing isn't possible, I would greatly value your technical feedback on the approach.
